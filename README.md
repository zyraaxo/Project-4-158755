Project Outline: Personal Fitness Goal Predictor
Project Idea
Develop a Streamlit-based web application that predicts and visualizes progress toward personal fitness goals (e.g., running distance, calorie burn, or step count) using machine learning models. The app will analyze fitness data to forecast goal achievement timelines and provide actionable insights for users, such as optimal workout schedules. This project combines regression modeling and time-series forecasting, deployed via a user-friendly Streamlit interface, with a Jupyter Notebook documenting the process.

Real-World Problem
Fitness enthusiasts often struggle to set realistic goals and lack personalized predictions to guide their training. A predictive tool can help users understand their progress, stay motivated, and optimize their routines to achieve goals like running a 10K or burning a target number of calories weekly.
