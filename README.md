Project Description: Real-Time Social Media Trend Forecaster
Overview
The Real-Time Social Media Trend Forecaster is a data science web application designed to identify and predict trending topics on the social media platform X in real-time, focusing on fitness-related hashtags (e.g., #Fitness, #Run, #HealthyLiving). The project leverages natural language processing (NLP) to extract trending keywords, regression modeling to predict post engagement (likes and retweets), and time-series forecasting to estimate trend popularity over the next 24–48 hours. Deployed as an interactive Streamlit web app, the tool provides visualizations (e.g., word clouds, trend curves) and actionable insights for marketers, influencers, or researchers to capitalize on emerging trends. The project is documented in a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook, ensuring clarity and reproducibility, and meets course requirements for a machine learning-driven software artifact without relying on personal data.

Real-World Problem
Social media trends evolve rapidly, making it challenging for businesses and content creators to identify and act on viral topics (e.g., #Fitness campaigns) before they peak. A predictive tool that monitors X in real-time, extracts trending hashtags, and forecasts their trajectory can help stakeholders optimize content strategies, increase engagement, and stay ahead of competitors. For example, knowing that #Run will peak in 12 hours allows a fitness brand to post relevant content at the optimal time.

Objectives
Extract Trends: Use NLP to identify trending hashtags and keywords from X posts.
Predict Engagement: Apply regression models to estimate post popularity (likes + retweets) based on features like sentiment, posting time, and weather.
Forecast Trends: Use time-series forecasting to predict hashtag popularity (e.g., hourly mentions) over 24–48 hours.
Visualize Insights: Deploy a Streamlit app with interactive visualizations (word clouds, engagement bars, forecast plots) for user-friendly trend analysis.
Ensure Originality: Create a novel dataset using simulated X posts, augmented with real-time weather data, to bypass API limitations and avoid overused datasets.
