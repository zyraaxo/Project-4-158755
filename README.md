Project 4 (158755) – Real-Time Social Media Trend Forecaster

Overview
This project delivers a real-time trend forecasting web app that analyzes fitness-related hashtags (e.g., #Fitness, #Run, #HealthyLiving) on X. It combines social media data with current news headlines (via the News API) and weather information to provide predictive insights. Using NLP and machine learning, it extracts trending keywords, predicts post engagement (likes and retweets), and forecasts topic popularity over 24–48 hours. The tool is deployed as an interactive Streamlit dashboard, offering visualizations like word clouds and trend curves. A Jupyter notebook documents the full data science workflow.

Problem Statement
Trends on X emerge and fade rapidly. Marketers, influencers, and researchers often struggle to anticipate these shifts. This project addresses that challenge by forecasting trend lifecycles, helping users optimize content timing and stay ahead of competitors.

Objectives

    Extract Trends using NLP from simulated X data and real-time news.

    Predict Engagement using regression models based on post features, sentiment, and weather.

    Forecast Hashtag Popularity with time-series models for 24–48 hour outlooks.

    Visualize Insights in a Streamlit app with interactive plots, word clouds, and filters.

    Ensure Originality by generating a custom dataset augmented with live news and weather data, avoiding API limitations and overused public datasets.
